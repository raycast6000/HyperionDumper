# Hyperion Dumper
A program that captures the images of Roblox's 'RobloxPlayerBeta.exe' and 'RobloxPlayerBeta.dll' modules (currently in the memory) and saves them in your disk.
# Usage
Load up Roblox and then run HyperionDumper. It usually takes between 5-10 minutes to dump both images.
Do not close Roblox or HyperionDumper until the dumping has finished. Otherwise, you might get a 120mb memory leak. In that case, if you mind, restart your computer to get the leaked memory back.
