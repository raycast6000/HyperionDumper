# Hyperion Dumper
A program that captures the images of Roblox's 'RobloxPlayerBeta.exe' and 'RobloxPlayerBetadll' modules (currently in the memory) and saves them in your disk.
# Usage
Load up Roblox and then run HyperionDumper. It usually **takes** between **5-10 minutes** to dump both images. \
Do not close **Roblox or HyperionDumper** until the dumping has finished. Otherwise, you might get a **120mb memory leak**. In that case, if you mind, restart your computer to get the leaked memory back. \
When you finish dumping the images, navigate to the directory HyperionDumper is in, and you will find two new files:

- _RW_RobloxPlayerBeta.exe

- _RW_RobloxPlayerBeta.dll \
Close HyperionDumper (either by pressing any key or just closing the console) and start your journey. Happy hacking!
